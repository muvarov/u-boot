config LWIP_LIB_DEBUG
	bool "enable debug"
	default n
	help
	  Enable DEBUG information for IP stack.
	  File net/lwip/lwipopts.h can be modified
	  to enable specific debug message like
	  raw packets or IP debug.

config LWIP_LIB_NOASSERT
	bool "disable asserts"
	default y
	help
	  Disabling asserts reduces binary size by 16k.
          lwIP assers are useful for testing, but for
	  the production code we can fight for the size
	  and reduce it with compile out asserts.
